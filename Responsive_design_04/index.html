        <h1>How to Create Fluid Media</h1>
        <p>At first glance the challenge of making images responsive seems simple. As you dig a little deeper, however,
            you'll find it's one of the most difficult aspects of responsive design.</p>
        <p><img src="_images/Venom-Wallpaper-Hd-26842.jpg" alt="venom" class="inline">Using fluid layouts ensures that
            as screen
            sizes or orientations change, content will reflow or reconfigure along with it. That works seamlessly for
            content such as text, which naturally reflows along with its containing element, but what about content that
            is by default defined at a fixed size, such as images or other media? An image designed for a large desktop
            monitor is unlikely to fit into a layout designed for a 320px wide smartphone. Likewise, images designed to
            accompany content on a mobile screen would probably look like thumbnails when viewed within desktop layouts.
            This means that in the best of circumstances these images will look out of context, and in many cases will
            break your carefully crafted responsive layouts.</p>
        <p>
            This problem underscores how important it is to find ways to make images and other media responsive.
            Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s just not that simple. Currently if you want to make images responsive you
            do have a couple of options. First, you could simply do what we discussed earlier; replace the fixed
            dimensions with percentages or relative units. You could even add a max-width property to avoid scaling the
            image up past its original size. To make the math of calculating image proportions a bit easier, you could
            also place the image in a flexible container and simply use a max-width = 100% property to constrain the
            image to the size of it&rsquo;s container.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <iframe width="960" height="515" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvZdDlqPsRc?si=3tqGQl1BEqxLFiIL"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            If the image is purely decorative and not necessary to the structure of the page, you could serve the image
            as a background image. By doing that, you could place requests for separate background images in each media
            query, ensuring that you&rsquo;re requesting only the image that you need for the proper device. This allows
            you to not only control the image&rsquo;s size but also the image&rsquo;s context. If you&rsquo;re scaling
            an image down with a lot of detail, for example, that detail will get lost as the image gets smaller. By
            serving a separate image for smaller layouts, you can crop the image or modify it to convey the right
            visuals for the appropriate space. </p>
        <p>To me, the issues surrounding responsive images illustrate the fact that responsive design is a totally new
            approach to designing web sites, and many aspects of it are still evolving. As such, as a designer
            you&rsquo;ll need to pay careful attention to how techniques change, and how implementations are carried out
            so that you&rsquo;re prepared to adopt them as they mature.</p>
